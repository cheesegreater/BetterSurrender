# BetterSurrender
*An Unturned plugin that makes surrendering great again*

BetterSurrender is a very basic plugin that intends to help those who choose to surrender instead of fight. When a player surrenders, they are given god mode and are unable to be killed by their opponents. Use this when you want to provide an enjoyable PvP experience while allowing pacifists to stay out of the action.
